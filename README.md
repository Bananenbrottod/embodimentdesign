# embodimentdesign

[Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) + [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/) based application to display a graph containing informations regarding papers that are connected with eachother.
The papers are proided in a `json` format in [src/data/gephi.json](https://github.com/Bananenbrottod/embodimentdesign/blob/main/src/data/gephi.json). This file can be generated by using the `SigmaJS exporter` plugin for Gephi.

## Prerequisites

Please make sure you have installed all the software mentioned below:

1. [Gephi](https://gephi.org/)
2. Gephi plugins -> [Where to install plugins](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mizvol/gephi-tutorials/master/SigmaJS%20exporter/images/Plugins.png)
    - Multigravity Force Atlas 2
    - Circle Pack
    - Label Adjust
    - SigmaJS exporter.
3. [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) - *[What is git?](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git%3F)*
    - You might as well need to [configure git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup) if you use it for the first time
5. [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
6. Recommended VSCode extensions -> [How to install extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace)
   - [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) ([and disable Vetur](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64901658/how-do-i-disable-vetur-linting-in-vscode-workspace))
   - [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin)
7. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/how-to-install-nodejs)

## First time Setup on local Machine

1. Open `VSCode`
2. Choose `Clone Git Repository..` -> a prompt will open at the top of the screen
3. Enter URL to this repository: `https://github.com/Bananenbrottod/embodimentdesign.git` and confirm
4. Choose a folder where the project shall be saved to

*NOTE: this has to be done once!*

## Start the Project on local Machine

1. Open `VSCode` and open the folder where the project was cloned to
2. [Open the VSCode integrated terminal](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/basics)
3. Run `npm install`
   - [Error: npm command not found](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/npm-command-not-found)
   - Error: no such file `package.json` -> check if you are in the correct folder with the terminal by running `pwd` - you have to be in the root folder of the project
4. Run `npm run dev`

This will start the application in a development setting and provide a link in the terminal that can be opened with `CTRL + CLICK`. Now you can test the application, make changes and they will be reflected in the given browser page.

## Updating the Data (gephi.json)

1. Open Gephi
2. File -> Export -> SigmaJS template
3. Fill in all required fields see [tutorial](https://blog.miz.space/tutorial/2020/01/05/gephi-tutorial-sigma-js-plugin-publishing-interactive-graph-online/)

When the export is finished a folder containing a `data.json` should be generated, this file shall be renamed to `gephi.json` and can then be used to replace the old [src/data/gephi.json](https://github.com/Bananenbrottod/embodimentdesign/blob/main/src/data/gephi.json).

## Build application and push to gh-pages

To update the application that is running on gh-pages and is implemented on the KIT website.

Execute `deploy` script that is defined in the [package.json](https://github.com/Bananenbrottod/embodimentdesign/blob/main/package.json)

````sh
npm run deploy
````

## General Project Structure

### /dist

### /node_modules

This is generated by running `npm install` and contains all needed node-modules for this project.

### /public

Holds the favicon.ico and other (image) files that should be loaded immediatly.

### /src

- /components
    - Here will be all of the custom components that are needed for the application.
- /data
    - Here the gephi.json file is placed which defines the nodes and edges. This is generated by the `SigmaJS exporter` Gephi plugin.
    *See [tutorial](https://blog.miz.space/tutorial/2020/01/05/gephi-tutorial-sigma-js-plugin-publishing-interactive-graph-online/) to export the data from Gephi*
- /plugins 
    - Holds the plugins that are used by the Vue.js application. The index.ts exports a function 'usePlugins' which registers all needed plugins to a given Vue.js App.
